### Weather App

##### Intro ☁️☀️⛈️
Hello and welcome to my weather app! Usable [here](https://lisonallie.github.io/Weather-App/), this weather app was created as a project to learn JavaScript. 

##### Objectives 📝💻📚
The objectives of the project were to create a weather app utilizing an API, display the weather for the upcoming 5 days, and create a home page with an input where the user could type in city names.

##### How it Works & Looks 👓🎨⚙️
The user types in any city into the input field on the main page. Once they press enter, the forecast for that city's next 5 days of weather pops up in 5 different divs spread across the page. Inside the divs for each day are the current temerature, hi & lo for the day, and an icon representing the forecast. The backgrounds of each div as well as the background of the weather container change based upon which icon is being displayed.

##### Resources ℹ️🥂💎
I used the icons from https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions. I found the backgrounds for each weather through https://www.pexels.com/ and Google. The API used was https://openweathermap.org/. I also used [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to access the API through an async function.
